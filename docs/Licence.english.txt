  ==========================================================
  
  NOTE:
  Please read this agreement carefully. By purchasing, downloading,
  installing or using the software, you agree to be bound by the
  provisions of this license agreement. If you do not agree to be
  bound by the provisions of this license agreement, you must not
  download, install or use the software.

  
  Property and proprietary rights
  
  This software - hereinafter referred to as "4images" - and the
  source texts are the intellectual property of the company Dots
  United GmbH - hereinafter referred to as "Dots United".

  4images, including the entire documentation, remains the property of
  Dots United even after the software has been transferred under
  license. 

  Dots United remains the proprietor of all rights to the programs
  transferred under license, including the appertaining material and
  the source texts, even if the user modifies them or links them to
  his own programs or to those of a third party.
  

  Area of validity / Scope of utilization
  
  4images can be used free of charge for private and non-commercial
  purposes. Commercial utilization is fundamentally said to exist
  whenever the operator of 4images is not a private person, a
  non-profit organization or an academic institution.
  
  Any commercial utilization requires the purchase of a license which
  can be purchased through our Online-Shop:
  http://www.4homepages.de/4images/order.php

  
  Scope of the license / Right of use
  
  The software may be installed on a server or on other storage media.
  A single copy can be made on a data carrier for purposes of backing
  up the data.

  4images may be used on a domain or server for an indefinite period
  of time. The simultaneous installation and use of the program for
  more than one domain is not permitted. However, the use is also
  permissible for those domains that are dependent, that are without
  any visible content and that are only intended to lead to the main
  domain.
  
  This right of use can be revoked or restricted if the software is
  employed inappropriately and it ceases with immediate effect in case
  of violation of this license agreement.

  
  Dissemination
  
  Any dissemination of a modified or unmodified version of 4images is
  only permitted with the express written consent from Dots United.


  Modifications
  
  Users of 4images can modify the software and/or adapt it for their
  own use at their own risk. Any and all visible and non-visible
  copyright information, including the hyperlinks in the source texts
  contained in said copyright information, must not be altered,
  removed or rendered unrecognizable or invisible.

  The removal of the visible copyright information at the footer of
  each output page of 4images can only be legalized through the
  purchase of a copyright-removal license.

  Accordingly, the user is entitled to modify the software, provided
  that:
  * this license agreement is not changed;
  * no possessory claim is made to any part of this software;
  * the copyright is not removed or altered, including but not
    restricted to the copyright in the output HTML files and the
    copyright in the source files;
  * the name "4images" is not changed in any source file or output
    file.
    
  A modification of the source files does not provide the user with a
  copyright that goes beyond the modification.

  
  Warranty, warranty claims

  Dots United does not provide any warranty or guarantee that the
  software will function flawlessly. Any and all claims against Dots
  United for damage due to or derived from improper functioning of the
  software are hereby excluded.

  Likewise, Dots United does not assume any liability for damage
  caused by the use of 4images.

  No guarantees are made pertaining to the data stored by 4images.

  
  Exclusion of liability
  
  4images must not be used in conjunction with the infringement of the
  intellectual property of third parties. This includes (but is not
  limited to), among other things, the infringement of copyrights,
  registered trademarks, trade secrets, patents, designs or utility
  models.
  
  Dots United is not obliged vis-à-vis the users of 4images to verify
  whether the use of 4images or its contents violates the rights of
  third parties or the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, of
  another country or of an international confederation of states;
  users are solely responsible for this.

  We hereby expressly refer to the legal provisions relating to
  competitive and press rights as well as those for the protection of
  trademarks, names, copyrights and industrial property rights and we
  recommend that the contents be examined in terms of compliance with
  said provisions before being released.

  A violation of these laws or rights exists especially if 4images or
  its contents contain prohibited pornographic or extremist political
  information or offers. Furthermore, any and all publications that
  incite hatred, are defamatory, insulting or factually incorrect must
  be refrained from.

  The user shall hold Dots United harmless from all claims put forward
  against Dots United due to a possible violation of rights as a
  result of the publication of contents using 4images. Insofar as
  claims for damages or other claims are put forward or asserted
  against Dots United, we reserve the right to fully obligate users to
  compensate for any loss suffered.


  Verification entitlement
  
  Dots United is entitled to verify at regular intervals whether this
  license agreement is being observed. In this context, no personal
  data and no information about the server will be collected. The only
  information that will be verified is the domain and the observance
  of this license agreement. If it is ascertained in this process that
  this license agreement is not being observed, Dots United reserves
  the right to take appropriate legal steps.

  
  Venue

  The venue for any matter arising from the license agreement shall be
  Mannheim, Germany.


  Escape clause
  
  In the event that individual provisions of this license agreement or
  the application of these provisions to individual persons or
  circumstances are partially or completely invalid, or should they
  contain a gap, the remainder of the license agreement or the
  application of these provisions to other persons or circumstances
  shall remain unaffected.
